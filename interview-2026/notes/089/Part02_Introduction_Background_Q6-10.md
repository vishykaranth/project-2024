## Question 10: What's the most challenging project you've worked on?

### Answer

The most challenging project I've worked on was architecting and implementing the Prime Broker system at IG India, which had to handle 1M+ trades per day with 99.9% accuracy while maintaining real-time position tracking and generating 400K+ ledger entries daily.

**The Challenge:**
The Prime Broker system is a critical financial system that:
- Processes 1M+ trades per day
- Must maintain 99.9% accuracy (financial compliance requirement)
- Tracks positions in real-time
- Generates 400K+ ledger entries daily
- Requires complete audit trail
- Must handle high-frequency trading scenarios
- Needs to integrate with multiple external systems

**Technical Challenges:**

1. **Scale & Performance:**
   - Processing 1M+ trades/day = ~12 trades/second average, with peaks of 100+ trades/second
   - Each trade triggers multiple operations (position update, ledger entry, settlement scheduling)
   - Needed sub-second response times

2. **Data Accuracy:**
   - Financial systems require 100% accuracy
   - Any error could result in financial loss or compliance issues
   - Needed robust validation and reconciliation

3. **Event Ordering:**
   - Trades must be processed in order for accurate position calculation
   - Needed to ensure event ordering across distributed services

4. **Consistency:**
   - Position calculations must be consistent across all services
   - Ledger entries must balance (double-entry bookkeeping)
   - Needed strong consistency guarantees

5. **Integration Complexity:**
   - Multiple microservices (trades, instruments, positions, ledger, settlement)
   - External systems (clearing, account systems)
   - Different communication patterns (Kafka, REST, JMS)

**The Solution:**

1. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - Designed Kafka-based event bus
   - Partitioned by accountId to ensure ordering
   - Event sourcing for audit trail

2. **Microservices Design:**
   - Trade Service: Validates and processes trades
   - Position Service: Calculates positions from events
   - Ledger Service: Creates double-entry ledger entries
   - Settlement Service: Handles settlement processing

3. **Data Consistency:**
   - Implemented Saga pattern for distributed transactions
   - Event ordering guarantees through Kafka partitioning
   - Reconciliation jobs for validation
   - Double-entry bookkeeping validation

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Redis caching for current positions
   - Database read replicas for queries
   - Batch processing for ledger entries
   - Connection pooling and query optimization

5. **Reliability:**
   - Circuit breakers for external integrations
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
   - Automated reconciliation

**The Results:**
- ✅ Successfully processed 1M+ trades per day
- ✅ Achieved 99.9% accuracy
- ✅ Generated 400K+ ledger entries daily
- ✅ Real-time position tracking
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ 99.9% system uptime

**Why It Was Challenging:**

1. **Financial Accuracy Requirements**: Any error could have serious consequences
2. **Scale**: Processing 1M+ trades/day with real-time requirements
3. **Complexity**: Multiple services, integrations, and consistency requirements
4. **Compliance**: Financial regulations require complete audit trails
5. **Zero Tolerance for Errors**: Financial systems can't have bugs

**Lessons Learned:**
- Importance of event sourcing for audit trails
- Value of event ordering guarantees
- Need for strong consistency in financial systems
- Critical role of reconciliation and validation
- Power of event-driven architecture for complex workflows

This project pushed my technical skills, required deep understanding of financial systems, and taught me the importance of accuracy and reliability in critical systems.
