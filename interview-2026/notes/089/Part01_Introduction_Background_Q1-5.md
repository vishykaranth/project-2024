## Question 1: Tell me about yourself and your career journey.

### Answer

Thank you for the opportunity. I'm Vishwanath Nagendra Rao, a Principal Engineer and Engineering Manager with over 15 years of experience building scalable, cloud-native microservices for enterprise B2B SaaS products.

**Early Career (2004-2015):**
I started my career at IBM Global Services in 2004, where I developed enterprise applications using Java and J2EE technologies. This foundation taught me the importance of clean code, proper architecture, and collaboration.

In 2005, I joined Goldman Sachs, where I spent 10 transformative years. I started as a Software Engineer and grew into more senior technical roles. I built the firm's strategic UI platform serving 5000+ users, implemented Security Lending Trading Flow processing $50B+ annually, and designed OTC Trade Processing systems handling 100K+ trades daily. A highlight was supporting the firm during the 2008 financial crisis in New York, where I handled peak trading volumes (5x normal) by implementing business isolation strategies.

**Mid-Career Growth (2015-2021):**
In 2015, I joined IG India as a Technical Architect, where I spent almost 5 years. This role allowed me to focus on architecture and system design. I architected the Prime Broker system handling 1M+ trades per day, designed the Revenue Allocation System processing 2M+ transactions daily, and built the Overnight Funding system (3rd highest revenue generator). I also built and led a development team from 2 to 12 engineers, establishing engineering best practices.

In 2020, I joined Allstate Solutions as Technical Architect/Engineering Manager, where I designed Kafka-based warranty processing microservices (10x throughput improvement) and architected payment gateway integration systems with 99.5% reliability.

**Current Role (2021-Present):**
Since 2021, I've been at Digit88 Technologies (LivePerson) as Principal Engineer/Engineering Manager. Here, I've scaled the conversational AI platform to 12M+ conversations/month (3x growth), reduced infrastructure costs by 40%, and achieved 99.9% uptime. I've also led global incident management, improved platform observability, and mentored teams using pair programming and clean code practices.

**Key Strengths:**
- Deep expertise in microservices, event-driven architecture, and Domain-Driven Design
- Strong domain knowledge in both Conversational AI and Financial Systems
- Proven ability to scale systems and teams
- Track record of delivering high-impact results

I'm passionate about building scalable systems, mentoring engineers, and driving technical excellence.
