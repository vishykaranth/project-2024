### Reframing Examples

#### Example 1: Technical Debt

**Before (Complaint):**
> "The codebase is terrible. We're always fixing bugs."

**After (Solution-Oriented):**
> "I've analyzed our bug patterns and identified that 60% come from legacy code. I propose a refactoring plan that would reduce bugs by 40% and improve development velocity."

#### Example 2: Too Many Meetings

**Before (Complaint):**
> "We have too many meetings. I can't get any work done."

**After (Solution-Oriented):**
> "I've tracked our meeting time and found we spend 15 hours/week in meetings. I've identified 5 meetings that could be async updates, saving 8 hours/week. Here's my proposal."

#### Example 3: Poor Requirements

**Before (Complaint):**
> "Requirements are always unclear. We waste so much time."

**After (Solution-Oriented):**
> "I've noticed requirements gaps are causing rework. I propose a requirements template and review process that would catch 80% of issues upfront."
