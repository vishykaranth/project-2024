## Types of "No" and How to Say Them

### Type 1: Capacity-Based No

**Scenario**: Already committed to other work

**Response Template**:
"I appreciate you thinking of me for this. I'm currently committed to [specific project] which requires my full attention until [date]. I want to give this the attention it deserves, so I can't take it on right now. However, [alternative option]."

**Example**:
"I'd love to help with this feature. I'm currently focused on the payment integration that's due Friday, and I want to ensure both get the quality they deserve. I could take this on starting next Monday, or [colleague] has experience in this area and might be available sooner."

### Type 2: Priority-Based No

**Scenario**: Request doesn't align with current priorities

**Response Template**:
"I understand this is important. Given our current priorities of [list priorities], this would require shifting focus. Let's discuss which priority we should adjust to accommodate this, or if this can wait until [timeframe]."

**Example**:
"This sounds valuable. Our current sprint is focused on [priority 1] and [priority 2]. To take this on, we'd need to deprioritize one of those. Should we discuss which to shift, or can this wait until next sprint?"

### Type 3: Skill-Based No

**Scenario**: Not the right person for the task

**Response Template**:
"I appreciate the opportunity. This requires [specific expertise] which isn't my area of strength. [Person/Team] has more experience with this and would be better suited. I'm happy to support in [specific way] if helpful."

**Example**:
"Thanks for thinking of me. This involves [specific technology] which [colleague] has been working with extensively. They'd be the better choice. I can help with [related task] or review the approach if that's useful."

### Type 4: Scope-Based No

**Scenario**: Request is outside your role/responsibility

**Response Template**:
"I understand the need. This falls under [department/role]'s responsibility. I want to make sure it gets the right attention from the appropriate team. I can [supporting action] if that helps."

**Example**:
"This is important, but it's typically handled by the DevOps team. They have the infrastructure expertise needed. I can provide technical input or help coordinate if that's useful."

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The "Yes, But" Approach

Instead of flat no, offer conditional yes:

**Template**: "Yes, I can help, but [condition]."

**Example**:
"Yes, I can review this PR, but given my current commitments, I can provide a thorough review by Thursday. If you need it sooner, [colleague] might be able to review today."

### Technique 2: The "Not Now, But Later" Approach

Defer rather than decline:

**Template**: "I can't take this on now, but I can [timeframe]."

**Example**:
"I can't start this today, but I can begin next week after I finish [current project]. Would that timeline work?"

### Technique 3: The "Delegate and Support" Approach

Pass to better-suited person while offering support:

**Template**: "[Person] is better suited for this, but I can [support]."

**Example**:
"[Colleague] has been working on similar features and would be perfect for this. I can provide context or pair with them if that helps."

## Common Scenarios and Responses

### Scenario 1: Last-Minute Request

**Request**: "Can you help with this urgent issue right now?"

**Response**:
"I understand this is urgent. I'm in the middle of [critical task] that I can't interrupt. I can help in [timeframe], or [colleague] might be available now. What's the business impact if we wait [timeframe]?"

### Scenario 2: Outside Your Expertise

**Request**: "Can you fix this infrastructure issue?"

**Response**:
"This is outside my area of expertise. The DevOps team handles infrastructure and would be better equipped. I can help troubleshoot the application side if that's relevant, or coordinate with them."

### Scenario 3: Low-Priority Request

**Request**: "Can you add this nice-to-have feature?"

**Response**:
"This sounds useful. Given our current sprint goals of [priorities], this would need to be prioritized. Should we discuss adding it to the backlog for next sprint, or is there something we should deprioritize to make room?"

### Scenario 4: Repetitive Request

**Request**: "Can you help debug this again?" (same issue)

**Response**:
"I'm happy to help, but I notice we've debugged similar issues before. Let me create documentation/guide so you can troubleshoot this independently. I'll also help this time, but the guide will save us both time in the future."
