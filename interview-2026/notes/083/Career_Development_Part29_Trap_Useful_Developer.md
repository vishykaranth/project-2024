```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Useful Developer Characteristics                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Positive Perception:
├─ "Always helpful"

├─ "Knows everything"
└─ "Reliable"

Hidden Problem:
├─ Doing low-value work
├─ No time for growth
├─ Not seen as strategic
└─ Career stagnation
```

## Why This Is a Trap

### Career Limitations

#### 1. No Time for Growth

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Time Allocation Problem                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Useful Developer Time:
├─ Helping with debugging: 3 hours/day
├─ Fixing others' issues: 2 hours/day
├─ Answering questions: 1 hour/day
└─ Low-value tasks: 2 hours/day

Time for Growth:
├─ Learning new skills: 0 hours

├─ Career-advancing work: 0 hours
└─ High-value initiatives: 0 hours
```

#### 2. Reputation as Helper, Not Leader

- Known for helping, not leading

- Good team player, not decision-maker
- Useful, not promotable

#### 3. Overwhelmed and Burned Out

- Too many requests
- No boundaries
- Constant interruptions
- Exhaustion and stress
