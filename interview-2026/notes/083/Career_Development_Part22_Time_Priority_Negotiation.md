## Negotiation Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Priority Matrix

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Priority Matrix                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

                Urgent
            │           │
            │   Do Now  │  Schedule
            │           │
    Not     ├───────────┼───────────
  Important │           │
            │ Delegate  │  Eliminate
            │           │
            └───────────┴───────────
              Important

Use this to:
├─ Categorize requests
├─ Discuss priorities
└─ Negotiate focus
```

### Strategy 2: The Trade-off Discussion

#### How to Present Trade-offs

**Template**:
"I can take on [new request], but that means [current priority] will need to be delayed. Here are the options:
1. Do [new request] now, delay [current priority] to [date]
2. Complete [current priority] first, start [new request] on [date]
3. Reduce scope of [new request] to fit current timeline
4. Add resources to handle both

Which option works best for the business?"

### Strategy 3: The Capacity Conversation

#### Showing Your Capacity

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Capacity Visualization                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Current Commitments:
├─ Project A: 40% of time (due Friday)
├─ Project B: 30% of time (due next week)
├─ Maintenance: 20% of time (ongoing)
└─ Available: 10% of time

New Request:
├─ Requires: 50% of time
├─ Timeline: This week
└─ Conflict: Can't fit

Solution Options:
├─ Delay new request
├─ Deprioritize Project B
├─ Reduce scope
└─ Add resources
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: New Urgent Request

**Request**: "We need this feature by Friday. Can you do it?"

**Negotiation**:
"I understand this is urgent. Let me show you my current commitments:
- Payment integration: Due Friday (40 hours)
- API refactoring: Due next Tuesday (20 hours)
- Bug fixes: Ongoing (10 hours/week)

**Total: 70 hours this week**

The new feature requires 30 hours. I have a few options:
1. **Delay payment integration** to next week (risks missing that deadline)
2. **Delay API refactoring** to next week (impacts other team)
3. **Reduce feature scope** to MVP (15 hours, full version next week)
4. **Add developer** to help with payment integration

Which option works best? I recommend option 3 - deliver MVP Friday, full feature next week."

### Example 2: Multiple "Urgent" Requests

**Situation**: Three stakeholders each say their request is urgent

**Negotiation**:
"I have three urgent requests. Let me help us prioritize:
- Request A: [business impact]
- Request B: [business impact]
- Request C: [business impact]

I can do one this week, one next week, and one the following week. Based on business impact, I recommend:
1. Request [X] this week (highest impact)
2. Request [Y] next week
3. Request [Z] following week

Does this prioritization work, or should we adjust based on other factors?"

### Example 3: Unrealistic Deadline

**Request**: "Can you build this in 2 days?" (Realistically needs 1 week)

**Negotiation**:
"I've analyzed what's involved:
- Core feature: 3 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Integration: 1 day
- Code review: 0.5 days

**Total: 5.5 days minimum**

Given the 2-day deadline, we have options:
1. **Reduce scope**: MVP in 2 days, full feature in 1 week
2. **Extend deadline**: Full feature in 1 week
3. **Add resources**: Two developers, 2-3 days
4. **Accept risk**: Rush it, but quality may suffer

I recommend option 1 or 2. Which works better for the business?"

## Key Phrases for Negotiation

- "I see why this is a priority"
- "I appreciate the urgency"

### Analysis Phrases
- "Let me show you my current commitments"
- "Based on my analysis..."
- "Here's what's involved..."

### Solution Phrases

### Collaboration Phrases

## Handling Pushback

### When They Push Back

#### Response 1: Stand Firm with Data
"I understand you'd like it sooner. Based on my analysis, [timeline] is what's needed for quality delivery. Rushing would risk [specific issues]. Here are the options that maintain quality..."

#### Response 2: Escalate if Needed
"If [timeline] is a hard business requirement, we need to discuss scope reduction or resource addition. Let's involve [manager] to make this decision."

#### Response 3: Document the Risk
"I can attempt [timeline], but I need to document the risks: [list risks]. If you're comfortable with these risks, I'll proceed, but I want to make sure expectations are clear."
