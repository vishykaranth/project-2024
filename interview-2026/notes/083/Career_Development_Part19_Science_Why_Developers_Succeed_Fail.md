├─ Collaboration skills differentiate
├─ Written communication matters
└─ Presentation skills open doors

Impact:
├─ Better team integration
├─ More opportunities
├─ Faster career growth
└─ Higher compensation
```

### Factor 5: Problem-Solving Approach

#### Systematic vs Ad-Hoc

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Problem-Solving Approaches                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Unsuccessful Approach:
├─ Jump to coding immediately
├─ Trial and error
├─ No systematic analysis
└─ Surface-level solutions

Successful Approach:
├─ Understand problem deeply
├─ Break down systematically
├─ Analyze before coding
└─ Comprehensive solutions
```
