# Part 49: System Design Interview - Quick Revision

## Interview Framework

- **Step 1: Clarify Requirements** (5-10 min)
  - Functional requirements, non-functional requirements
  - Scale (users, requests, data), constraints, assumptions

- **Step 2: High-Level Design** (10-15 min)
  - Draw major components, show data flow
  - Identify APIs, discuss trade-offs

- **Step 3: Deep Dive** (15-20 min)
  - Database schema, scaling strategies
  - Caching approach, load balancing, failure handling

- **Step 4: Optimization** (5-10 min)
  - Performance improvements, cost optimization
  - Monitoring, future enhancements

## Key Principles

- **Start Broad**: High-level architecture first
- **Think Aloud**: Explain your reasoning
- **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements, don't assume
- **Discuss Trade-offs**: Show understanding of alternatives
- **Iterate**: Improve design based on feedback

## Common Mistakes

- **Jumping to Solutions**: Understand requirements first
- **Ignoring Scale**: Consider scale from the beginning
- **No Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros/cons
- **Perfect Solution**: Good enough is often sufficient

## Communication

- **Draw Diagrams**: Visual representation helps
- **Explain Decisions**: Why you chose specific approach
- **Handle Questions**: Answer follow-up questions clearly
- **Time Management**: Allocate time appropriately
