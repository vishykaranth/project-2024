### Parenting

Believe me, I know exactly how it is to have our minds elsewhere while little hands tug at our knees for attention. Being a parent can be downright overwhelming with that never-ending mental to-do list, let's face it. It's too easy to lose sight of the important things, right? Of being in the NOW with your kids and ourselves. 

The mind is constantly overworked and undernourished. Our thoughts race ahead too often, leaving the body behind. And then comes social media distractions, phone pings, emails, cleaning duties, and endless scrolling simply to 'feel' something. It's often like there's just not enough time to give our kids the attention they crave.

Well...Being a present parent isn't about giving constant attention. It's about the quality of our attention when we're with our kids. It's listening - really listening - when they talk about their day at school. It's showing we care when they're feeling down. These small moments? They're huge!

Being there for our kids isn't just about physical presence. It's about emotional availability too. It's about developing that parental sixth sense, the one that helps us spot potential dangers before they even happen. We're like superheroes in training, always on alert, always ready to swoop in and save the day. But it's not just about preventing scraped knees or bumped heads. It's about creating a safety net of love and support that our kids can feel, even when we're not right beside them.

This kind of attentiveness doesn't come easy. It takes practice, patience, and a whole lot of coffee. We learn to read the signs, to understand the quiet before the storm, to sense when something's not quite right. We become experts in our children's moods, their habits, their little quirks. And in doing so, we'll be protecting them from physical harm, but more than that, we'll be teaching them how to navigate the world, trust their instincts, and be aware of their surroundings.

This one’s a message from me to you. Try to be there - really there - a little more each day. Let's put down our phones, push aside our worries, and be in their world. Before we know it, those little hands tugging at our knees will be waving goodbye as they head off to college. And when that day comes, we want to look back and know we didn't just watch them grow up, we were part of the journey, every step of the way.
