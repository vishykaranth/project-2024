
## Early Retirement 
- To quote the Dalai Lama ''The ultimate source of happiness is found within oneself.'' 
- The true source of happiness for most of us would come from 
  - living a purposeful life, 
  - having meaningful work, 
  - loving family and friends, 
  - good health, 
  - new experiences, 
  - helping others and 
  - constantly learning. 
- If one was to focus on this source of happiness, 
  - money is bound to follow. 
- Thus, work towards being happy because the riches will be right around the corner.
