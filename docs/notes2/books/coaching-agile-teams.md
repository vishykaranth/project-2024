## 1. Will I be a Good Coach?

If teams are to have kinds of stellar experiences, leverage agile to teh full competitive advantage it was meant to
provide.

Agile coaching matters because it helps both, producing products that matter in the real, complex and uncertain world,
and adding meaning to people's work lives.

Agile is easy to get going yet hard to do well.

Imagine a team that admits mistakes, reinforces their shared values, forgives one another, and moves on. Do you think
such a team would come up with astonishing ideas?

An agile (or Scrum) coach is:

- someone who appreciates teh depths of agile practices and principles and can help teams appreciate them too
- someone who has faces big dragons, organizational impediments, and has become a coach to managers and other outsiders
  in the course of addressing them
- someone who can help management at all levels of the organization the benefits of working agile
- someone who has brought ideas from professional facilitation, coaching, conflict management, mediation, theater and
  more to help the team become a high-performance team

Native wiring for coaching:

- ability to "read a room", ability to read emotion in the air and know whether all is good
- care about people more than products
- cultivate curiosity
- believe that people are basically good
- they know that plans fall apart, so they act in the moment with the team
- any group of people can do good things
- it drives them crazy when someone says "yeah, I know, it's a waste of time, but that's how we do it here"
- chaos and destruction are simply building blocks for something better
- they risk being wrong
