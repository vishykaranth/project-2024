## 1. Guard Classes

If you see code like:

```
if condition: ...
```

or

```
if condition:
    if another condition: ...
```

tidy the above to:

```
if not condition: return
if not another condition: return
...
```

Exit immediately, it is easier to read -- before we get into the details, there are some preconditions we need to bear
in mind.

## 2. Dead code

Delete it. If you need it later, use version control. Delete only a little code in each tidying diff. Just in case, if
it turns out that you were wrong, it will be easy to rever the change.

## 3. Normalize symmetries

Tidy forms of unnecessary variations. Use common style for your functions. Things get confusing when two or more
patterns are used interchangeably.

## 4. New Interface, Old implementation

If some interface you need to use is very difficult to use, implement the interface you wish you could call and call it.
Implement the interface by simply calling the old one.

## 5. Reading Order

Reorder the code in the file in the order in which a reader would prefer to encounter it.

## 6. Cohesion Order

If 2 functions are coupled, put them next to each other, if 2 files are coupled, put them in the same directory, ...

If you know how to eliminate coupling, go for it.

## 7. Move Declaration and Initialization Together

It is easier to understand the code if each of the variables is declared and initialized just before it's used. It is
hard to read when declaration is separated from initialization.

## 8. Explaining variables

When you understand a part of a big, hairy expression, extract the subexpression into a variable named after the
intention of the expression.

Always separate the tidying commit from the behaviour change commit.

## 9. Explaining constants

Create a symbolic constant. Replace uses of the literal constant with the symbol.

## 10. Explicit parameters

It's common to see blocks of parameters passed in a map. This makes it hard to read and understand what data it
required. Make the parameters explicit:

```
foo(params) -> foo(a, b)
```

## 11. Chunk statements

The simplest tidying. Put a blank line between 2 parts doing different things. After you've chunked statements, you have
many paths forward: Explaining Variables, Extract Helper or Explaining Comments.

## 12. Extract helper

A block of code that has an obvious purpose and limited interaction with the rest of the code can be extracted into a
helper function. Using the helper can be taken care of in another tidying.

## 13. One pile

Sometimes you read the code that has been split into many tine pieces, which makes it hard to understand. The biggest
cost of code is the cost of reading it, not the cost of writing it.

Sometimes in order to regain the clarity, the code must be merged together, so new, easier-to-understand parts can be
extracted.

## 14. Explaining comments

Write down only what wasn't obvious from the code. Put yourself in the place of the future reader, or yourself 15
minutes ago.

Immediately upon finding a defect is a good time to comment. It is much better to add the comment that points out the
issue, rather than leaving it buried in the sand.

## 15. Delete redundant comments

When you see a comment that says exactly what the code says, remove it.

## 16. Separate Tidying

Tidying should go into their own separate PRs, with as few tidyings per PR as possible. Behavior and structure changes
should be in separate PRs.

## 17. Chaining

Tidying can set up another tidyings. You will begin to flow tidyings together to achieve larger changes to the
structure of your code. Be wary of changing too much, too fast. A failed tidying is expensive relative to the cost of a
series of successful tidyings.

## 18. Batch Sizes

The more tidyings per batch, the longer the delay before integrating, and the greater the chance that a tidying collides
with someone else is doing.

The change of a batch accidentally changing behavior rises with the number of tidyings in the batch.

The more tidyings per batch, the more we are prone to tidying just because, with all the additional costs that creates.

In many orgs, the fixed cost of getting a single change through review and deployment is substantial. Programmers feel
this cost, so they move right in the trade-off space (despite collisions, interactions, ...).
