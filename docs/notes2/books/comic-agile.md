## 1: Transformation

Instead of taking a waterfall approach to your agile transformation, take an iterative one and grow the scope
organically. Focus on changing the organizational culture to align with an agile one.

Product Owners don't dictate anything just because they are accountable for maximizing the value through effective
product backlog. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on creating a plan for the next Sprint.

Asses the psychological safety in your organization. If it is too low, seek to make working agreements where blameless
post-mortems are part of them, so you can create a culture of promoting healthy conflicts and celebration of mistakes (
and learning from them). Help your managers in demanding more psychological safety from their superiors, as that is a
prerequisite for the managers creating it for you.

If you only partly adopted the agile way of working, the scope and time might be fixed, so the only parameter that the
teams can rally vary is how much technical debt to create.

## 4: Team

Team Velocity - the velocity is only for the team. If Management doesn't get that, educate them on the purpose and
nature of velocity.

Technical Debt - If you PO doesn't get the importance of reducing Technical Debt, you need to educate them - spending
some time now on reducing the technical debt will most likely decrease time-to-market of new features.

Avoid external participants in the team's retrospective (lack of trust to the externals).

Use a simple tools for building agile culture, by taking a just-enough approach to your tooling, you free ip energy to
focus on the needed behavioral changes.

DevOps is not just about tools, testing and CI/CD pipelines - it is more about culture, breaking down silos and
aligning cross-functional teams tp the paths of value delivery.

WIP limit should create a pull system in the team's flow. This should then bring a conversation about collaboration and
the knowledge sharing needed to ensure that the entire team can actually swarm around each PBI.

Mob Programming - is about working collaboratively in groups of +3 to deliver high quality software and/or share
knowledge between the developers in the mob. The Driver - controls the keyboard, the Navigators are thinking,
discussing, reviewing and reflecting. The roles are interchanged.

Stability is the foundation for building the trust needed to become high-preforming teams. If team keeps changing, they
will have difficulties moving up Tucksman's phases - forming, storming, norming, performing.

## 6: Miscellaneous

In the spirit of openness, you don't have to wait for the Retrospective to bring up potential improvements to your ways
of working.

Companies with diverse leadership are 45% more likely to grow their market share and 70% more likely to capture new
markets compared to companies with "non-diverse" leadership. Behavioral diversity is the other half of the equation,
which includes:

- ensuring everyone is heard
- making it safe to propose novel ideas
- giving team members decision-making authority
- sharing credit for success
- giving actionable feedback
- implementing feedback from the team
